# Daily YouTube sync (Phase 3a)

A GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/youtube-sync.yml`) runs every day at 03:17 UTC (and on demand from the Actions tab → *YouTube sync* → *Run workflow*).

**What it does**
1. Reads the channel through the YouTube Data API (about 40 quota units a day; the limit is 10,000).
2. Adds new videos to `data/videos.jsonl`, rebuilds `site/catalogue.json`, checks the site still builds, and publishes the change. Cloudflare then redeploys.
3. Writes a summary on the run page: new lessons, lessons that disappeared, how many videos wait for review.

**What gets published automatically:** only videos whose title names the Sheikh (or that you approved by hand with `manage.py`). Other speakers' uploads stay in the database with status `REVIEW` and never reach the site. Live streams and premieres appear after they finish.
The five main series are also matched against the channel's playlists, which fill in lessons whose title no pattern recognises; disagreements between title and playlist are listed in the run summary, never applied silently (see `docs/data-formats.md`).
Videos deleted/made private on YouTube are marked `REMOVED` and disappear from the site. Your manual curation (series, lesson number, Arabic title, approvals/rejections) is never overwritten.
Safety stops: if more than 3 lessons would vanish, or YouTube answers only partly, the run fails and **publishes nothing** (you get GitHub's failure email).

## One-time setup (owner)
1. GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
   - **Secrets → New repository secret:** `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` = your key. (Your local `.env` is not visible to GitHub.) In Google Cloud, restrict the key to *YouTube Data API v3*.
   - **Variables → New repository variable:** `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_HANDLE` = `@wahatsunnah12` (optional; this is the default).
2. Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → **Read and write permissions** (needed to commit).
3. Run it once by hand (Actions → YouTube sync → Run workflow) and read the summary.
4. If you turn on branch protection for `main` later, the Action can no longer push directly: add the repository variable `SYNC_MODE` = `pr` (and tick "Allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests" in the same Actions settings page). It then opens a daily pull request that you merge.

## Your side of the workflow
`data/videos.jsonl` (text) is now the source of truth; `videos.db` is a local working copy.
- After `git pull`: `python tools/videos_text.py load` rebuilds your local `videos.db`.
- After curating with `manage.py`: `python tools/videos_text.py dump`, then `python build_catalogue.py`, then commit `data/videos.jsonl` and `site/catalogue.json`.
- Once, when convenient: `git rm --cached videos.db` and commit (keeps your local file, stops tracking the binary).
